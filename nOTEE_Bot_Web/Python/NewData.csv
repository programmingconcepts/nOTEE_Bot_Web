The simultaneous monitoring of multiple indicators, nutrition advice, and plant diagnosis system makes hydroponic farming monitoring a difficult work. But by implementing artificial intelligence-based regulating algorithms in the agriculture industry, new technology advancements are highly helpful to address these issues. Therefore, the development of a desktop application with an IoT-based smart hydroponics system is the main emphasis of this study. The proposed IoT system is broken down into three phases, the first of which provides a physical environment with real-time sensors including a water pump, fan, and TDS sensor temperature that are all controlled and run by an Arduino UNO Board. The second phase incorporates weather monitoring for Internet of Things purposes utilizing the Open Weather Map API and Google's Realtime Database. In the third phase, farmers can use a desktop application connected via an IoT environment to monitor sensor data. The farmer may use the application to continually monitor the condition of his field in this way. The suggested system can be used to switch ventilation system and water pump on or off over the internet from anywhere. Environmental threats impacting most of the EU and the rest of the globe include water scarcity and pollution. Water scarcity is predicted to worsen much further, endangering food production. This issue requires many approaches in order to be resolved because it cannot be handled in one step. Several environmental factors, including water quality and availability, soil quality, and energy availability, affect food security. Several environmental problems have developed as a result of agriculture's broad and taxing practice during the past few decades. Water quality and quantity, which are currently declining, are predicted to be impacted by climate change [1,2]. A high-tech and capital-intensive system called ""smart farming"" is based on the use of contemporary ICTs (information and communication technologies) in agriculture. A system is created for sensor-assisted agricultural field monitoring and irrigation system automation in IoT-based smart farming. ATLAS Scientific [3] and Libelium Waspmote [4] are two companies that provide electronic sensors and microcontroller-based solutions for sensing ambient conditions and water quality. Such solutions are illustrated in a number of research publications, as indicated by the surveys of [5,6]. To achieve accurate and efficient agriculture, it is crucial to use other significant ICTs that have been effectively applied in other situations like these, such as big data [7], blockchain [8], and neural networks [9]."
Overview,"control hydroponics, iot control, hydroponics, hydroponics accurate, things iot","The goal of this project is to create an Internet of Things (IoT) system that can control a hydroponics system's temperature, relative humidity, and TDS level. The importance of hydroponics is in giving the common individual a method to produce their own food without using soil, especially for those who live in apartments and urban locations. In hydroponics, accurate meteorological data, including air temperature, relative humidity, and water irrigation techniques, is crucial."
Literature/Background Studies/Review/Related Work,"soil sensors, irrigation efis, management irrigation, evaluation crop, recognize illnesses, picture characteristics, learning iot, diagnosis iot, tree classification, fruit tree, decision tree, forecasting agricultural, hydroponic automation","This part focuses on a thorough study of current approaches and their shortcomings. The authors of [10] created the Internet of Everything (IoE), which is regarded as a cutting-edge framework for the development of IoT. This device used cutting-edge soil sensors to keep an eye on the agricultural field. The recommended technique uses more energy and decreases efficiency when computing the heat index of the components to observe the environment for crop development. In addition, the nations of Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa have developed the effective management of irrigation system (EFIS) [11] for automatic water regulation. This position monitors the soil quality and water levels. However, the parameters' current consumption and the system's data transmission range are reduced by this system. To classify plant diseases, sensor data is used with a machine learning model known as a support vector machine (SVM) [12]. The controller of the camera model employed in this model is designed to take into account the leaf's temperature, humidity, color, and moisture content. However, the significant computational complexity of this technology is a drawback. In [13], authors concentrated on using calculational intelligence techniques for wheat crop nitrogen forecast and usage. The estimate is based on the evaluation of crop images that were taken in the field in real time under various time samples and lighting conditions. To further categorize the plant illnesses, an artificial neural network with genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) is applied. However, the low categorization accuracy of this approach is a drawback. Additionally, a classifier called MicConvNet [14] is being developed to find red palm weevil larvae early on and safeguard date plants. Based on a modified mixed depth-wise convolution network, this detection technique. However, owing to complexity concerns, this solution did not implement the IoT environment. Additionally, a dual image database is used to train the hybrid convolutional neural network (HCNN) [15]. The database was trained to recognize these illnesses using photos that have previously been contaminated. Second, picture characteristics for texture, color, and morphology are extracted. However, this strategy required more training time to train features. In [16], the authors used deep learning with IoT to automatically detect plant diseases. With a modified ResNET51 model that was utilized on the cloud for the aim of developing smart illness diagnosis, the IoT is used to remotely sense field parameters and store them. Due to its poor classification performance, this approach suffers. The authors of [17] created a mobile application that efficiently displays sensor information by managing the field. Additionally, the disease-affected region is stored using specified classes via IoT. In addition, DeepLens [18] variants are shown for continuous data monitoring with ubiquity and dependability. These variations access data through cloud data integration with recursive CNN classification. The condition of fruit tree and vegetable plant leaves is determined using the RCNN. This approach, however, cannot be used to diagnose a large number of plant and tree diseases. Decision tree classification is also used in the development of the smart agriculture technologies enabled by AI and IoT [19] system. AI processes the hardware data, which offers vital information for forecasting all agricultural factors. However, in a real-world setting, this system has problems with electricity. The authors of [20] built an IoT-based, AI-based agricultural system, and this approach provides feedback to farmers for the best maintenance of crop output. Fuzzy logic is used by the AI system to anticipate crop kinds, soil integration, and meteorological conditions. The hydroponic automation system for plant growth analysis from seed stage to yield stage was established by the authors in [21]. The ESP32 microcontroller is further used to operate a variety of sensors and actuators. The LOTUS mobile application was also upgraded to provide temperature, humidity, and irrigation monitoring. This approach has a significant computational cost, though. The authors of [22] created a hybrid system with several monitoring parameters, including fertilizer content, pH, and water temperature. Additionally, a machine learning strategy based on K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is employed to automate these settings in accordance with the reference water levels produced by the nutrient film technique. However, compared to deep learning models, this approach is less reliable and efficient."

Compared to hydroponics, conventional farming has the following drawbacks: Water Use: Traditional farming frequently uses ineffective irrigation techniques, which results in severe water waste. Contrarily, hydroponics uses up to 90% less water than conventional soil-based agriculture since it recycles water. Land Use: Large areas of fertile land are needed for traditional farming, which can result in habitat loss and deforestation. The use of hydroponics can relieve pressure on natural ecosystems by allowing for the production of plants in smaller areas, including urban settings. Weather Dependent: Traditional farming is heavily reliant on the weather, which leaves crops susceptible to droughts, floods, and very high or low temperatures. Because they offer a controlled environment, hydroponic systems enable year-round, weather-independent growing. Soil Degradation: Continuous soil cultivation in conventional farming can cause soil erosion, a loss of fertility, and the deterioration of agricultural land. By not using soil, hydroponics helps to address these problems. Pesticide Use: Chemical pesticides are frequently used in traditional farming to battle pests and illnesses, but doing so can have negative environmental effects as well as health hazards for consumers. The use of pesticides can be decreased by using integrated pest management techniques in hydroponic systems. Weed Control: Weed management in traditional farming involves using pesticides or physical weeding, both of which may be time-consuming and harmful to the environment. Weeds are completely eliminated by hydroponics. Despite being the foundation of agriculture for many years, conventional agricultural practices now confront greater difficulties due to resource constraint, environmental sustainability, and food security. Many of these issues may be creatively solved by using hydroponic systems, which also offer a more effective and ecological method of growing crops."

Forest Fire Detection using Smoke Detector INTRODUCTION,"forest fires, forests conservation, managing woods, conservation safety, forests, forest communication, sensor networks, sensor networks","Forests conservation and management are crucial tasks for the environment's security and well-being. These dangers stem from a number of factors, such as dry weather, lightning, and human activity, that can ignite forest fires. Places with dense vegetation provide a serious risk. Therefore, whether managing woods for timber, recreation, or conservation, fire safety should always come first. A simple forest fire detection system's design must include wireless sensor networks. These networks gather information from various environmental sensors and forward it to a processing terminal or central computer for examination. Numerous sensor nodes that are dispersed throughout and connect with one another inhabit the forest. The communication method is greatly influenced by the network topology or architecture that is selected. The mesh and star topologies are the two primary network topologies that will be examined in the context of this study [1]. Every node in a mesh design is linked to at least two additional nodes. In contrast, every node in a star network is linked to a hub, which is sometimes referred to as the central node, and other nodes are only able to interact directly with this hub. Wireless sensor networks provide several advantages, including reduced wiring, simplicity of implementation, and a non-intrusive way of monitoring forest conditions—that is, monitoring without exposing people to potentially hazardous circumstances. Moreover, environmental management may be done remotely, which enables decision-making and interaction between authorities and the environment without requiring physical presence [2]."
INTRODUCTION Overview,"environmental monitoring, forest management, monitoring techniques, vulnerable wildfires, wildfires early, sensor networks, sensor network, networks sensor, wireless sensor, sensor nodes","Early detection systems are essential for maintaining public safety and protecting the environment in forested regions. Monitoring the condition of the ecosystem can assist in locating and controlling high-risk regions that are vulnerable to wildfires. Early forest condition monitoring techniques, such as observation towers and human patrols, are comparable to historical fire detection tactics. Forest management authorities may utilize sophisticated environmental monitoring systems to react wisely to any fire threats based on the copious amounts of data these systems provide. Rapid reaction and removal are made possible by the monitoring system's capacity to detect unanticipated changes in the surrounding environment, such as rapid temperature spikes or the presence of smoke. These days, wireless sensor networks, or WSNs, are gaining popularity all over the world. A WSN is an ad hoc, multi-hop, self-organizing network with several nodes spread out across a large region that is used to monitor events of interest. The domains of science, medicine, the environment, and the military might all benefit from it. Wireless sensor networks are mostly made up of sensor nodes, also referred to as motes. They detect phenomena, whereas base nodes manage the network and gather information from other nodes that are far away. Scalability, fault tolerance, operating system, sensor network architecture, hardware limitations, transmission media, and power consumption are a few factors that affect sensor network design [3]."
INTRODUCTION Statement of Problem,forest fires,"In example, during dry seasons, forested places might have habitats that are distinct and perilous. Forest managers must thus devise quick solutions for difficult issues, such as tracking and collecting data from several nodes in real-time and continually monitoring environmental factors. The hardware architecture of the sensor nodes and software flow diagram for a forest fire detection system constructed using the nRF24L01 are described in this paper. The sensor groups of the system keep a close eye on the temperature, humidity, and smoke levels in the forested area. The microcontroller sends the measurements to the wireless communication module. Because it tracks potential fire hazards in forests and verifies environmental conditions, the system has the potential to increase monitoring efficiency and decrease the effect of forest fires."
INTRODUCTION Purpose of the project,"wireless sensor, readings wireless","The project aims to create a wireless sensor network with a variety of sensors in order to provide a real-time monitoring system for forest fire detection. The project also includes the desktop software. Large wireless transmission range radio frequency modules form the basis of the method. As of right now, the system has sensors for fire, smoke, humidity, and temperature. It monitors the forest's temperature, humidity, smoke, and fire risk. The microcontroller processes these values before sending them via nRF modules to the receiver module. After the receiving device has processed the data and evaluated it, the real-time readings of the wireless sensor are shown on the computer's screen. Early warning audio warnings about potentially dangerous situations, such high temperatures and smoke, are produced by the research. As a result, alerts are sent out prior to the outbreak of a forest fire."
INTRODUCTION Applications of the project,"identification fires, forested ecosystems, fires forest, forested, monitoring forest, forest indicators, sensors nrf, nrf modules, connection sensors, detecting smoke, forest signs, smoke temperature, sensor network, wireless sensor, building wireless, monitoring","Unexpected temperature surges and smoke, for example, can be harbored in forested ecosystems and pose a serious risk to nearby populations and wildlife. To protect these areas, threats of this kind must be promptly identified, and dangerous circumstances must be notified as soon as possible. Although traditional monitoring methods, such as patrols and observation towers, have increased the identification of fires, not all forest habitats are suitable for them [4]. A real-time monitoring system might aid in controlling and monitoring the forest ecosystem. Because of its various benefits, nRF technology is perfect for real-time monitoring systems. Thus, the main goal of this project is to set up an effective real-time monitoring system that will enable the identification of various forest fire indicators as soon as they appear and facilitate the development of appropriate preventative measures. Following are the milestones to be achieved for this project: Establishing connection between sensors and nRF modules detecting smoke, temperature changes, and other forest fire signs building a wireless sensor network; and creating a real-time monitoring system"

We want to express our attempt through writing, with the assistance of various ""Authors"" and ""Scientists"" and their separate research and labor histories. These are the findings from previous study on various environmental safety systems that employ various technologies. Yu et al. (2005) proposed using a wireless sensor network to create a real-time forest fire warning system. The system collects and evaluates data using the WSN to detect forest fires. Neural networks were used to create the detection and monitoring sensor networks [5]. In their 2007 research, Joseph et al. focused on the challenges and hazards associated with fire in libraries and archives, describing the required safeguards to be taken. They gave critical recommendations for selecting and installing the appropriate fire alarm system, as well as explaining the major components used in fire detection and warning systems [6]. Fischer (2007) devised and implemented a fire detection system using simulation techniques. To limit the potential of false alarms during non-fire circumstances, this technology can discriminate between places that are on fire and those that are not. Tan et al. (2007) developed a system for tracking mine safety. The effort was called the WSN-based Mine Safety System. This technology can offer an early warning of an explosion or fire and monitor the subsurface environment in real time [7]. Based on the peculiarities of underground mine galleries and mine safety requirements, Niu Xiaoguang et al. (2007) proposed a distributed hybrid structured mining monitoring prototype system (HHMSM). This gadget monitors the methane concentration and the miner's position. To improve traffic and management, they proposed an adaptive overhearing-based data gathering system that takes use of sample readings' redundancy and correlation in both time and place [8]. He Hongjiang and colleagues (2008) created a system that employs the low-power S3C2410 ARM processor chip as the primary controller and Zigbee as a platform for WSN communication. This system consists of monitoring sensors, a CAN-BUS communication network, and the network mode [9]."
